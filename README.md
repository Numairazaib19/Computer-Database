This repository contains the test cases, preconditions, test steps, test data, expected results, actual results, status (pass or fail), and comments for the integration test scenario. To ensure accurate testing, please follow the provided test steps, use the designated test data, and record the expected results. After executing each test, compare the actual results with the expected results and update the status accordingly (pass or fail). Feel free to add comments or additional observations to enhance the test documentation. Your contributions and feedback are highly appreciated as they help improve the quality and reliability of the computer database project.
